# 🌍 Journey to Data Engineering & AI

### _by Nabiya Maredia_

Welcome to my personal learning journey — a space where I document, build, and reflect on my path toward becoming a Data Engineer and AI practitioner.

This repository is more than just code; it’s a living record of persistence, structure, and curiosity.  
From humble beginnings with Python fundamentals to architecting real-world data pipelines — this is where it all unfolds.

This isn’t a bootcamp repo or a copy of tutorials. It’s my structured, hands-on path — documenting every week, every lab, and every realization as I move from Python basics to full-fledged data pipelines and AI integration.

## 🧭 Repository Structure

| Folder                | Description                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **roadmap/**          | Structured weekly assignments from my Data Engineering & AI learning roadmap (16+ weeks of guided progression). |
| **capstones/**        | Larger, end-to-end projects integrating concepts from data pipelines to AI models.                              |
| **practice_archive/** | My early learning materials and experiments, including Py4E and exploratory notebooks.                          |
| **docs/**             | Reflections, notes, and summaries about concepts, tools, and milestones.                                        |

## 🗓️ Current Phase: _Foundations & Setup_

📍 **Week 1 – Setup and Python Basics**  
→ [roadmap/week01_setup_and_python_basics](./roadmap/week01_setup_and_python_basics/)

- Verified global Python environment and logged package versions
- Practiced initial Python scripting and problem-solving
- Learned how to organize, document, and version control my work

## 📈 Progress Tracker

| Phase  | Focus Area                        | Status         |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Week 1 | Environment Setup                 | 🔄 In Progress |
| Week 2 | Data Fundamentals (Pandas, Numpy) | ⏳ Upcoming    |
| Week 3 | SQL for Data Engineers            | ⏳ Upcoming    |

_(Will update weekly as I move through the roadmap.)_

## 🧠 Reflections

- Each assignment is a small victory, a step toward mastering the craft of data engineering and AI.
- When I began this, I didn’t just want to _learn_ data engineering — I wanted to _understand it deeply_:  
  how data flows, scales, and becomes meaningful.
- Each folder here represents a checkpoint — a small, steady step in that direction.
- This journey isn’t about rushing to the finish — it’s about building endurance, understanding, and clarity.

## 💡 Tech Stack (growing list)

- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools:** VS Code, Jupyter, Git, GitHub
- **Upcoming:** Airflow, Spark, dbt, Snowflake, AWS
