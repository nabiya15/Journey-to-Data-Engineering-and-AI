# Lab 1.1 — Environment Setup and Version Logging

**Scenario:**  
You have recently joined a data engineering team responsible for maintaining production ETL pipelines.  
Before you can contribute, your team lead requires that your development environment be **reproducible, auditable, and version-logged**.  
This ensures that all engineers across the team run identical environments — minimizing “it works on my machine” issues in production.

Your task is to **automate the setup validation** of your local Python environment and generate a `setup_log.txt` file that documents key version information.

---

## Question (Exam Format)

Design and implement a Python script named `setup_environment.py` that performs the following tasks:

1. **Version Verification:**

   - Retrieve and display the following version details:
     - Python interpreter
     - pip package manager
     - Operating system
     - Virtual environment status (if any)

2. **Package Snapshot:**

   - Retrieve and list the versions of commonly used data engineering libraries:
     - `pandas`, `numpy`, `pytest`, and `requests`
     - If any are missing, handle the exception gracefully and record `"Not Installed"`.

3. **Environment Log Generation:**

   - Write all collected details into a text file named `setup_log.txt`
   - The file must be timestamped and formatted for readability.
   - Include both console output and file output confirmation messages.

4. **Error Handling & Output Validation:**
   - Ensure the script runs without breaking even if certain packages are unavailable.
   - Provide clear log messages in both the console and text file.
