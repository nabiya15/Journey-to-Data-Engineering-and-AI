# List of CLI

### Here I am documenting all the commands that I will encounter througout my journey. Documentation improves my memory

| Command | Option          | Example                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mkdir   | -p or --parents | mkdir -p project/src/main/java | This single command would create project, then src inside project, then main inside src, and finally java inside main. Without the -p flag, you would need to execute multiple mkdir commands sequentially for each level of the directory structure. |
| ls      | no option       |                                | Lists the contents of a directory                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ls      | -l              |                                | Displays a detailed list of file attributes, including permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and last modification time.                                                                                                                  |
| ls      | -R              |                                | Lists the contents of directories recursively, including all subdirectories and their contents.                                                                                                                                                       |
| ls      | -r              |                                | Reverses the sorting order of any other sorting option (e.g., -tr to sort by modification time in reverse order, oldest first).                                                                                                                       |
