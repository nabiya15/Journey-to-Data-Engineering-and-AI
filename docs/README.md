# 🧭 Data Engineering & AI Learning Roadmap

This document outlines the complete learning journey I’m following — from foundational Python work to building full data pipelines and exploring cloud, analytics, and AI integration.  
Each **phase** builds intentionally on the previous one — combining conceptual depth, practical labs, and career-ready deliverables.

---

## 🌱 Phase 1 — Foundations: Python & Environment Setup

**Weeks 1 – 2**

- Master core Python concepts and scripting practices
- Learn to set up reproducible development environments
- Apply automation and testing basics through mini projects
- Explore initial data wrangling with Pandas

**Key Tools:** Python, GitHub Copilot, VS Code, pytest, Pandas  
**Example Labs:**

- Workstation Commissioning Checklist
- Inventory Audit Utility
- Employee Grading Automation
- Reusable Data Cleaning Module

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2 — Data Fundamentals & SQL Analytics

**Weeks 3 – 4**

- Strengthen SQL query writing, joins, aggregations, and optimization
- Work hands-on with AWS S3 and IAM as part of data handling
- Develop structured data-analysis pipelines in SQL and Python

**Key Tools:** MySQL / PostgreSQL, AWS S3, EC2, IAM, Mode Analytics  
**Example Labs:**

- SQL Schema Setup & Filtering
- Analytical Views and Performance
- S3 Bucket Operations & Data Transfer
- AWS Account Setup and Permissions

---

## 🧩 Phase 3 — ETL Workflows & Data Modeling

**Weeks 5 – 7**

- Learn to design and automate ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipelines
- Implement modular transformations with dbt Core
- Build dimensional models and introduce CI/CD testing

**Key Tools:** Pandas, dbt Core, AWS Compute, GitHub Actions  
**Example Labs:**

- CSV Extraction and Transformation Script
- Database Load and Logging Pipeline
- dbt Project Initialization and Model Testing
- CI/CD Automation and Lineage Visualization

---

## ☁️ Phase 4 — Integration & Modern Data Stacks

**Week 8 +**

- Connect real-world data sources with **Airbyte**
- Integrate pipelines with **Snowflake** / BigQuery data warehouses
- Perform validation, orchestration, and documentation
- Strengthen end-to-end understanding of ELT architecture

**Key Tools:** Airbyte, Snowflake, BigQuery, AWS CLI, dbt  
**Example Labs:**

- Airbyte Connector Setup
- Source & Destination Configuration
- Data Validation and Warehouse Load

---

## 🤖 Phase 5 — AI Enhancement & Career Integration

**Capstone Stage**

- Combine data engineering with AI-powered tooling
- Learn prompt engineering, automation, and documentation best practices
- Build portfolio-ready capstones that showcase technical and storytelling ability

**Key Areas:**

- AI-augmented ETL & analysis
- Resume and portfolio automation using LLMs
- Cloud deployment of final projects

---

## 🧱 Capstone Projects (End of Phase 5)

1. **End-to-End Data Pipeline:** From ingestion → transformation → visualization
2. **AI-Assisted Analytics App:** Integration of LLMs for data insights
3. **Cloud Deployment:** Automated ETL on AWS or GCP
